# What is SWANA

SWANA is an acronym that stands for Southwest Asian, or North African, which includes people of Southwest Asian or North African (SWANA), or Middle Eastern or North African (MENA), descent. Southwest Asian or North African is an alternative term to the acronym MENA, which is also commonly used in the data disaggregation of Middle Eastern groups. 

It is important to note that consensus on the identity groups included in the terms SWANA or MENA is still being built. These labels are attempts to distinguish the distinct experiences of these communities from the White experience in the United States, the group they have traditionally been folded into when it comes to data. These groups encompass a diversity of origins and intersections between national, geopolitical, religious, and ethnic identities. For years, advocacy organizations representing these communities have advocated for the inclusion of a MENA category in the U.S Census. While the U.S. Census Bureau still delays in including MENA in data collection, our proxy estimates are the best available to further disaggregate data and shed light on the unique and lived experiences of these groups.

We estimate the number of people who identify as SWANA by summing the number of people who reported any SWANA ancestry. We define SWANA ancestry based on the following categories: Afghan, Algerian, Arab, Assyrian, Bahraini, Chaldean, Egyptian, Emirati, Iranian, Iraqi, Israeli, Jordanian, Kurdish, Kuwaiti, Lebanese, Libyan, Middle Eastern, Moroccan, North African, Omani, Palestinian, Qatari, Saudi, Sudanese, Syrian, Tunisian, Turkish, Yazidi, and Yemeni. Note that these are labels and terms used by the U.S. Census Bureau, which may not reflect more inclusive and preferred terms by these groups. This list is also not exhaustive and likely will continue to change. For instance, our estimates currently do not include people who identify as Armenian though this is a group that crosses national origins that are often included in SWANA. This list is also limited by census data collection. Some groups not included in the data are Amazigh, Copts, Druze, and Bedouin.
