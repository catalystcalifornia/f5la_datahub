The data are by racial-ethnic group, Service Planning Area (SPA) and county for 2022 and 2023. For this data update, Catalyst California analyzed poverty at both the 100% FPL level and the 138% FPL level. Data is analyzed for both FPL levels for years 2022 and 2023. Estimates that are cut by race use 2022 and 2023 5-year estimates. Estimates at the SPA level and county level use 2022 and 2023 1-year estimates.\r\nLink to the workbook\r\nCatalyst California also created a PUMA to SPA crosswalk map to visualize which PUMAs across Los Angeles County fall within each of the five SPAs.The code for creating this crosswalk and the map visualization can be found further below on this page.\r\nMap of Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs), LA County Service Planning Areas (SPAs), and Crosswalk\r\nData for households with children 0-5 in poverty is available by PUMA and the request is for that data by SPA. We created a PUMA-SPA crosswalk to facilitate calculating numbers and percentages of households with children 0-5 by SPA.\r\nThere are 71 PUMAs in LA County with blue borders with identification numbers between 03703 and 03782, with 037 being the LA County identifier. These numbers are on the initial labeling on the map hover.\r\nThere are 8 SPAs in LA County with black borders numbered one through eight below. You can see these labels by turning off/unchecking the PUMA layer. Note: SPA 7 has a cut out of SPA 8 in the Signal Hill area.\r\nThe crosswalk of PUMAs to SPAs we use to attribute household 0-5 poverty data are the colored areas, colored by SPA. The areas without colors are the smaller portions of PUMAs that overlap multiple SPAs. For example, the non-colored portion of PUMA 03709 (at the center of the map in La Canada Flintridge) is the portion of PUMA 03709 that falls in SPA 2. The vast majority of PUMA 03709 falls in SPA 3, so it is attributed to SPA 3 and not SPA 2. We donâ€™t attribute fractions of PUMAs to SPAs because the additional the potential increase in accuracy is outweighed by a decrease in statistical stability.\r\nBelow is the code for visualizing the PUMAs to SPAs crosswalk:\r\n\r\nReading layer `Service_Planning_Areas__2022_' from data source \r\n  `W:\\Project\\RDA Team\\First5LA\\Ad-hoc Research\\Laura ask poverty

    "contents": "\r\nThe Best Start Region 5 State of the Child Report represents the most comprehensive analysis of data from the region to date, consolidating data on children, families and systems in the Antelope Valley. Childrenâ€™s Bureau of Southern California commissioned this report to understand the state of children in the Antelope Valley, identify indicators to monitor, and increase the amount of data available to advocates.\r\nYou can view and download the report in its entirety here.\r\nThe report finds that:\r\nThe family-friendly, low-cost-living in the Antelope Valley, that residents love and depend on, is disappearing and a new, more proactive infrastructure for children and families is needed. The current infrastructure was not established for the population increases the Antelope Valley has experienced in the last decade, and the lack of resources is a driver for school-to-prison, youth-to-houselessness pipelines, and other avoidable outcomes. To be specific:\r\nAntelope Valley has a large, diverse, and growing population with roughly 120,000 children under the age of eighteen and 30,000 children under age 5, including many children who need extra support.\r\nHalf of the households in and around the neighborhoods of Lancaster and Palmdale cannot cover basic costs like housing, food, transportation, and child care with their incomes, and four in five families with children under the age of six earn less than the real cost of living.\r\nHigh housing costs and lower wages contribute to a growing unhoused population in the region. Resources available in the Antelope Valley are not keeping up with the needs of the residents. Residents struggle to access health and mental health services and there are few child care and learning opportunities for their children.\r\nEquitable treatment of local children and families is a concern. Rates of hate crimes exceed those countywide, and law enforcement is known to both stop Black drivers and injure Black civilians more than people of other races.\r\nHigh School graduation rates in Antelope Valley schools are lower than those countywide. School administration and the teacher workforce are not representative of the diversity within the student body. Foster students and students with disabilities â€“ students who may need the most support â€“ are most likely to be suspended from school.\r\nTo address these ongoing issues, increased investments in health and mental health are needed, as are increases in child care reimbursement rates and other forms of investments in education within the region. Strengthening the safety net of programs which provide resources or training to residents is a must. Individuals can collaborate to hold systems accountable and spread awareness of resources as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This research question was lifted by F5LA and might be incorporated into our F5LA deliverable.\r\nFor this research, I pulled child care center and family child care home data from the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) page. The data was last downloaded on 01/07/21 and is updated on the CDSS page weekly.\r\nIt is important to note that using the licensing data has limitations. Data from the CDSS page only reflects permanent facility closures. These are facilities that no longer have a license to operate. For the purposes of this analysis, facilities that are pending having their licenses approved are also considered closed.\r\nThe CDSS data does not show the reason a facility permanently closed. Many facilities have had to close due to new Covid-19 guidelines, or a decrease in enrollment and funding. However, these closures could be excluded from this data because the facility owners can still have their license but cease operations. These type of closures can be thought of as â€˜temporary closuresâ€™ because the facility owners still have a license. Temporary closures are not captured in the data, resulting in an under-representation of facilities that are no longer providing services to families.\r\nWhile this research focuses on permanently closed facilities, the facilities that are open are being impacted by Covid-19. Anecdotes from providers and families reveal that many facilities are heavily impacted by Covid-19, which the data might not accurately capture. Women of color and immigrant women in particular, who disproportionately represent child care workers, are shouldering the burden for providing early learning and care to families.\r\nFor more information on how Covid-19 has been impacting child care in California and Los Angeles, please refer to the Center for the Study of Child Care and Employmentâ€™s (CSCCE) survey of licensed child care centers and licensed family child care programs.\r\nThe survey results show that family child care homes and child care centers in Los Angeles are facing significant financial challenges and staffing changes as a result of Covid-19.\r\nOver 70% of centers reported that families are unable to pay for childcare due to loss of income\r\nMajority of centers report difficulty in affording sanitizing supplies and PPE for staff.\r\nMap of Permanent Closures\r\nBelow shows the child care facilities and family home care centers that have closed permanently in 2020. Please note that for family home care centers, addresses for each facility was not available. Family home care centers are plotted by the state, city and zip code information. Child care facilities are plotted based on the facility address.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary of Findings\r\nChild Care Centers\r\nMore Child Care Centers closed permanently in 2019 compared to 2020 in both California and Los Angeles County\r\nThere was a huge spike in child care center closures in June of 2020 in California, resulting in a substantial number of seats lost. Los Angeles County did not experience the same drastic spike.\r\nCompared to California, Los Angeles County has fewer closures and seats lost.\r\nIn Los Angeles County, permanent closures decreased in April of 2020.\r\nFamily Care Centers\r\nFamily Child Care Centers in California experienced a spike in closures and seats lost in August of 2020\r\nBoth Los Angeles County and California experienced a decrease in closures in April of 2020, similar with Child Care Centers\r\nThe difference between California and Los Angeles County closures and seats lost is lower compared to the California and Los Angeles County child care centers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1: Summary of Permanent Closures and Seats Lost\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCalifornia\r\n\r\n\r\nLos Angeles County\r\n\r\n\r\nPermanent Center Closures\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily Child Care Home\r\n\r\n\r\n2019\r\n\r\n\r\nChild Care Center-Closures\r\n\r\n\r\n725\r\n\r\n\r\n180\r\n\r\n\r\n2020\r\n\r\n\r\nChild Care Center-Closures\r\n\r\n\r\n691\r\n\r\n\r\n134\r\n\r\n\r\nChild Care Center\r\n\r\n\r\n2019\r\n\r\n\r\nChild Care Center-Seats Lost\r\n\r\n\r\n32,269\r\n\r\n\r\n8,507\r\n\r\n\r\n2020\r\n\r\n\r\nChild Care Center-Seats Lost\r\n\r\n\r\n30,708\r\n\r\n\r\n6,024\r\n\r\n\r\nSeats Lost\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily Child Care Home\r\n\r\n\r\n2019\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily Child Care Home-Closures\r\n\r\n\r\n937\r\n\r\n\r\n194\r\n\r\n\r\n2020\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily Child Care Home-Closures\r\n\r\n\r\n894\r\n\r\n\r\n207\r\n\r\n\r\nChild Care Center\r\n\r\n\r\n2019\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily Child Care Home-Seats Lost\r\n\r\n\r\n13,041\r\n\r\n\r\n2,696\r\n\r\n\r\n2020\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily Child Care Home-Seats Lost\r\n\r\n\r\n12,434\r\n\r\n\r\n2,856\r\n\r\n\r\nChild Care Centers\r\nClosures\r\nClosures in 2020 by month\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClosures in 2020 by day\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClosures in 2019 vs.Â 2020\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeats Lost\r\nSeats lost in 2020 by month\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeats lost in 2020 by day\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeats lost in 2019 vs.Â 2020\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily Child Care Homes\r\nClosures\r\nClosures in 2020 by month\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClosures in 2020 by day\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClosures in 2019 vs.Â 2020\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeats\r\nSeats Lost in 2020 by month\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeats Lost in 2020 by day\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeats Lost in 2019 vs.Â 2020\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
