Catalyst California supported First 5 LA in its strategic refinement process by processing key indicators related to children 0-5 across the Best Start Geographies for 2008-2012 and 2017-2021.

The final product is a webpage consisting of maps that visualize changes over time to key indicators for households with children age 0-5. All maps are visualized at the PUMA geography level for 2012 and 2021. Both the 2012 and 2012 data come from American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates. The 2012 data is comprised of the 2008-2012 ACS 5-year estimates, while the 2021 data is comprised of the 2017-2021 ACS 5-year estimates.
