A Strategic Partnership with Catalyst California was created in 2019 to support understanding the current conditions in Best Start geographies for First 5 LA staff. The work was initially created for the Communities Team at First 5 LA to have data that can advance policy and systems change. An internal cross Team/Office workgroup guides this effort with Catalyst California. First 5 LA staff and Regional Network Grantees were engaged to lift up community priorities in Best Start geographies.
