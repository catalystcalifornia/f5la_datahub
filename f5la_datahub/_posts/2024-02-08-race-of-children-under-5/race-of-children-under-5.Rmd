## Why it matters?
Conversations about the under 5 population need to consider the needs of Latinx families, including:

 * dual language access for children, and materials for parents in both English and Spanish.

## Learn more.
The importance of race and equity in the caring and educating of children under 5 cannot be overstated. See more in the [Data Narrative](https://apca-dev.dreamhosters.com/) for details.
